# Random message generator!

### This is my second attempt based on the solution provided by CodeCademy.
* Arrow function generating a random number based on the parameter/argument "num".
* OptionsObject is just that, an object. The object keys has arrays as values.
* randomizedMessage is declared as an empty array.
* A for in loop, that loops through the keys inside the object "optionsObject".
* Each loop generates a random number based on the length of each keys array.length.
* Switch case used with a template literal pushed into an array for each case.
* Function joinArray takes in an array as an arguement and joins it with a linebreak
into a new variable that's is then logged for the result given.
